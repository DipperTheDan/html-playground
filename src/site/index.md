This is a place to help us understand how HTML elements behave in their out-of-the-box state, before we start adding CSS and JavaScript.

A very small amount of CSS has been added to the site in order to make it as readable as possible, for example:

- the font size has been increased
- a sans-serif typeface has been specified
- the page content has been limited

<nav aria-label="On page">

## Choose an area of the playground

- [Content](/content/)
- [Forms](/forms/)
- [Page structure](/structure/)
- [Dynamic content](/dynamic/)

</nav>
