<p>This is a place to help us understand how HTML elements behave in their out-of-the-box state, before we start adding CSS and JavaScript.</p>

<p>A very small amount of CSS has been added to the site in order to make it as readable as possible, for example:</p>

<ul>
    <li>the font size has been increased</li>
    <li>a sans-serif typeface has been specified</li>
    <li>the page content has been limited</li>
</ul>

<h2></h2>

<nav aria-label="On page">
    <h2>Choose an area of the playground</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/content/">Content</a></li>
        <li><a href="/forms/">Forms</a></li>
        <li><a href="/structure/">Page structure</a></li>
        <li><a href="/dynamic/">Dynamic content</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>
